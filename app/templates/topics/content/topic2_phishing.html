<h2>Phishing & Scam Awareness</h2>
<p>
  Phishing is when attackers pretend to be someone you trust to steal your information, money,
  or access to your accounts.
</p>

{{ callout("warn", "Big red flag", "Any message asking for your OTP / verification code is almost always a scam.") }}

<h3>Common phishing types</h3>
{{ bullets("You’ll see phishing in many forms", [
  "Email phishing: fake emails from ‘banks’, ‘HMRC’, ‘delivery’, etc.",
  "Smishing: phishing via SMS/text messages",
  "Vishing: phishing via phone calls",
  "Social media DMs: fake giveaways, urgent messages, impersonation"
]) }}

<h3>How to spot it fast</h3>
{{ bullets("Phishing signs", [
  "Urgency: ‘act now’, ‘account will be closed’",
  "Pressure: ‘don’t tell anyone’, ‘do it quickly’",
  "Suspicious links: strange domain names or shortened links",
  "Requests for codes, passwords, bank details, or remote access",
  "Poor spelling, odd formatting, strange sender address"
]) }}

<h3>What to do if you receive one</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t click the link</li>
  <li>Open the app/website yourself (official route)</li>
  <li>Verify using a different channel (call the known number)</li>
  <li>Report and block the sender</li>
</ul>

{{ takeaway([
  "Phishing = pretending to be trusted",
  "Urgency + OTP request = huge warning",
  "Verify by going to the official app/website yourself",
  "When unsure, pause and confirm through another channel"
]) }}
