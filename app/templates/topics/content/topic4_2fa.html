<h2>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
<p>
  2FA adds a second layer of security. Even if someone steals your password,
  they still need the second factor to log in.
</p>

{{ callout("info", "Simple idea", "Password = something you know. 2FA = something you have (phone/app) or something you are (biometrics).") }}

<h3>Common 2FA methods (best to worst)</h3>
{{ bullets("2FA options", [
  "Authenticator app (recommended): Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy",
  "Passkeys / device prompts: ‘Approve sign-in’ on your phone",
  "Hardware key: YubiKey (very strong)",
  "SMS codes: better than nothing, but can be intercepted"
]) }}

{{ callout("warn", "Important", "Never share a 2FA code/OTP with anyone — not even ‘support’ or ‘bank staff’.") }}

<h3>Best practice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use an authenticator app where possible</li>
  <li>Save backup codes in a safe place</li>
  <li>Turn on 2FA for email first (email controls resets for other accounts)</li>
</ul>

  "2FA blocks account takeovers even if password is stolen",
  "Authenticator apps are safer than SMS",
  "Backup codes are your recovery plan",
  "Never share OTP codes with anyone"
