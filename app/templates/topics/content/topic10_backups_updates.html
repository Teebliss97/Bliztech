<h2>Backups & Device Updates</h2>
<p>
  Updates fix security holes. Backups protect you if something goes wrong (lost device, ransomware,
  accidental deletion).
</p>

<h3>Why updates matter</h3>
{{ callout("info", "Simple truth", "Most successful hacks use old known vulnerabilities that updates already fixed.") }}

{{ bullets("Update habits", [
  "Turn on automatic updates where possible",
  "Update browsers, apps, and operating system",
  "Restart your device when updates require it"
]) }}

<h3>Backups (your recovery plan)</h3>
{{ bullets("Good backup approach", [
  "Use cloud backup (Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud) for key files",
  "Keep an external drive backup for important data",
  "Test restore occasionally (make sure it actually works)"
]) }}

{{ callout("warn", "Ransomware protection", "If you have a backup, ransomware loses power over you. You can wipe and restore instead of paying.") }}

{{ takeaway([
  "Updates close security holes",
  "Backups protect you from loss and ransomware",
  "Automatic updates + cloud backup = strong baseline security"
]) }}
