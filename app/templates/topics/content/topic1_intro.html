<h2>Introduction to Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>
  Cybersecurity is about protecting your devices, accounts, and data from digital attacks.
  It’s not only for “tech people” — it affects everyone who uses the internet.

{{ callout("info", "Think of it like this", "Cybersecurity is like locking your house: doors (passwords), alarm (2FA), CCTV (monitoring), and safe habits (awareness).") }}

<h3>What are we protecting?</h3>
{{ bullets("Key things worth protecting", [
  "Your money (banking, shopping, transfers)",
  "Your identity (personal details, IDs, accounts)",
  "Your privacy (messages, photos, location)",
  "Your devices (phone, laptop, tablet)",
  "Your reputation (social accounts, impersonation)"
]) }}

<h3>Common threats (you’ll meet these in later topics)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> fake messages that trick you into clicking or paying</li>
  <li><strong>Malware:</strong> harmful software that steals data or damages devices</li>
  <li><strong>Password attacks:</strong> guessing, re-use, and leaked passwords</li>
  <li><strong>Scams:</strong> manipulation + urgency to make you act fast</li>
</ul>

{{ callout("warn", "Golden rule", "If something is urgent, emotional, or too good to be true — slow down and verify.") }}

{{ takeaway([
  "Cybersecurity is for everyone online",
  "Protect money, identity, privacy, and devices",
  "Most attacks succeed because of human tricks, not ‘high-level hacking’",
  "Slow down, verify, and build safe habits"
]) }}
