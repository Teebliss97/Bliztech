<h2>Passwords & Passphrases</h2>
<p>
  Your password is your first line of defence. Weak or reused passwords are one of the most common
  reasons accounts get hacked.
</p>

{{ callout("warn", "Common mistake", "Using the same password on multiple apps. If one site gets breached, attackers try the same password everywhere.") }}

<h3>What makes a strong password?</h3>
{{ bullets("Strong password checklist", [
  "Long (12+ characters is a good start)",
  "Unique for every account (no re-use)",
  "Hard to guess (avoid names, birthdays, simple patterns)",
  "Prefer a password manager for storage and generation"
]) }}

<h3>Passphrases (recommended)</h3>
<p>
  A passphrase is a longer phrase that’s easier to remember but still strong.
</p>

{{ callout("info", "Example passphrase", "River-Train!Purple-Coffee-2025 (long + mixed + memorable)") }}

<h3>Best practice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use a <strong>password manager</strong> (Bitwarden, 1Password, etc.)</li>
  <li>Enable <strong>2FA</strong> on important accounts</li>
  <li>If you suspect compromise, change passwords immediately</li>
</ul>

{{ takeaway([
  "Length + uniqueness beats cleverness",
  "Never re-use passwords across accounts",
  "Password managers make strong passwords realistic",
  "2FA adds a second protective layer"
]) }}
